# The 8 Principles of I Know My LLM

These actionable principles help you evaluate AI platforms and protect yourself from fraud. They are open for community refinement.

## 1. Verify Credentials Thoroughly

**Dig into roles, histories, and team depthbeyond profiles, seek independent confirmation.**

Don't accept titles at face value. "Former Senior Executive at [Major Bank]" might actually mean "Technology Project Manager who worked on CRM upgrades." Cross-reference LinkedIn profiles with regulatory databases, company registries, and independent news sources.

Red flag example: "100+ years of combined AI experience" 3 LinkedIn reveals 35 years total, 4 in AI specifically.

**Action Items:**
- Cross-reference LinkedIn with FINRA BrokerCheck, SEC filings
- Verify claimed publications on Google Scholar
- Check company registries for actual roles and tenure
- Look for independent confirmation beyond self-reported profiles

## 2. Demand Concrete Proof

**Require working demos, named references, and verifiable case studies before sharing data.**

Real products have real demos. Real success stories have contactable references. If you can't see it working and can't talk to anyone who's used it, you're being sold a promise, not a product.

Red flag example: "Sign this NDA, provide sample data, then we'll schedule a preliminary discussion" 3 Translation: no working demo.

**Action Items:**
- Request live demos in your own environment
- Ask for named, contactable references (not just logos)
- Verify case study companies exist and can confirm the claims
- Never share data before seeing the product work

## 3. Spot Hype and Jargon

**Identify invented terms, generic AI copy, and unsubstantiated claims as red flags.**

If terms only exist on one website, they're marketing, not technology. If you can replace "AI" with "blockchain" and the sentence still works, it says nothing meaningful.

Red flag example: "Financial AGI with Cognitive Knowledge Orchestration4" 3 Google Scholar results: 0. Academic papers: 0.

**Action Items:**
- Search unfamiliar terms in Google Scholar and academic databases
- Check if terminology exists outside the company's own materials
- Be wary of trademarked jargon that has no external validation
- Test AI claims by substituting other buzzwords4does it still make sense?

---

## 4. Audit Security Independently

**Check certifications, data practices, and access controlsdon't trust words alone.**

Real security means audited certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001), not reassuring sentences. Ask for actual audit reports, not just claims of being "enterprise-grade" or "bank-level secure."

**Action Items:**
- Request copies of actual security certifications and audit reports
- Ask specifically: Where is data stored? Who has access? How is it encrypted?
- Verify certifications with the issuing bodies
- Check for data breach history

---

## 5. Research Regulatory Standing

**Review FINRA, SEC, FCA filings, and physical/financial legitimacy for stability.**

Legitimate financial-adjacent companies have registrations. Legitimate businesses have verifiable addresses. If you can't find them in regulatory databases and the address is a mailbox or coworking space, proceed with extreme caution.

Red flag example: "Senior bank executive managing billions" 3 FINRA shows no registration, ever.

**Action Items:**
- Search FINRA BrokerCheck for financial industry claims
- Check SEC EDGAR for company filings
- Verify addresses via Google Street View
- Review state/national business registries
- Check FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), or relevant local regulators

## 6. Question Urgency and Terms

**Challenge artificial scarcity, NDAs, and exit optionsensure fair, transparent deals.**

Artificial scarcity is manipulation, not legitimate business. Excessive NDAs before any value exchange suggest there's something to hide. And always understand your exit options before entering.

**Action Items:**
- Reject artificial time pressure ("only 3 spots left")
- Question any NDA required before seeing a demo
- Understand data portability and contract termination rights
- Review pricing transparency and hidden fees
- Ensure fair terms for both parties

---

## 7. Document Everything

**Record claims, communications, and interactions for accountability.**

Screenshots today, evidence tomorrow. Keep records of all promises, demonstrations, and communications. If things go wrong, documentation is your protection.

**Action Items:**
- Screenshot marketing claims and promises
- Save all email and chat communications
- Record meeting notes with dates and attendees
- Keep copies of contracts and terms
- Document any discrepancies between claims and reality

---

## 8. Leverage Instincts and Community

**Trust your gut; consult shared wisdom and collective experiences when in doubt.**

If something feels wrong, it probably is. But don't rely solely on your own judgmentseek out others who have evaluated or used the platform. Community wisdom catches what individuals miss.

Red flag example: If it feels too good to be true, ask around. Someone else has probably already discovered why.

**Action Items:**
- Trust your instincts when something feels off
- Search for independent reviews and experiences
- Ask in professional communities and forums
- Share your own findings to help others
- Report suspicious patterns to relevant authorities

## How to Contribute

These principles are community-driven. To suggest changes:

1. **Open an Issue** to discuss proposed modifications
2. **Submit a Pull Request** with specific edits
3. **Join Discussions** to debate principle refinements

All contributions should focus on ethical, generic guidanceno specifics about particular companies to maintain legal safety and broad applicability.
